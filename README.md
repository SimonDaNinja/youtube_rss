# youtube_rss

This is a collection of tools I'm developing for use in a (hopefully) upcoming anonymous YouTube client.

As my current plan is to use RSS to keep track of "subscriptions" to channels (not to be confused with
YouTube's own subscription system, which requires a Google account and is not compatible with anonymity),
much of the material is focused on getting ahold of and parsing RSS-content.

This is NOT an application, but rather it is a module meant to help with application development.
